## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using exploratory data analysis (EDA), lookalike analysis, and clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## Files Included
The repository contains the following files:
- **EDA**:
  - `Adarsh_Shankar_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis.
  - `Adarsh_Shankar_EDA.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the findings from the EDA.

- **Lookalike Analysis**:
  - `Adarsh_Shankar_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for lookalike modeling.
  - `Adarsh_Shankar_Lookalike.csv`: Dataset used for lookalike analysis.

- **Clustering**:
  - `Adarsh_Shankar_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing clustering algorithms.
  - `Adarsh_Shankar_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report detailing the clustering results and insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   
2. Navigate to the project directory
   
3. Install the required libraries (if you haven't already):
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter


## Usage Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda).
2. Run the cells in the notebooks sequentially to reproduce the analyses.
3. Review the visualizations and reports generated in each section.

## Results and Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations that illustrate customer segments identified through clustering techniques. Key visual outputs include:
- Elbow method plot for determining optimal clusters.
- Silhouette scores plot for evaluating cluster quality.
- PCA scatter plots showing customer segmentation.
- Cluster centers visualization indicating where each cluster is centered.

Feel free to explore the notebooks to see detailed analyses and results.
